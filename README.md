# PlenaData Junior Assesment

### Explanation:
This code takes a String as input and then prints the first occurrence of the letter which is not repeated. After this, it arranges the String based on its occurrence. 

### Run:

- Use the following commands if you are executing using terminal or command prompt:
```
Compile: javac Solution.java
Run: java Solution
```
### Final Questions:

1. The assessment took me around 1.5 hours because initially I was using LinkedHashMap which made my code lengthy and more complex so later on I used Priority Queue based on occurrences of characters. I have assumed ascii values as the character set.
2. I am available to join immediately
3. I am currently in Binghamton and upon getting an offer I can definitely move to Utah within next 3 months
